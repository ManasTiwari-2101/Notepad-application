# 📝 Simple Notepad App (Tkinter)

This is a beginner-friendly Notepad application built using Python's `tkinter` module.  
I created this project to learn the basics of GUI programming in Python.

It includes basic features like:
- Opening and saving `.txt` files
- Editing text (cut, copy, paste, clear)
- Changing font style
- Scrollable text area

## 🚀 How to Run the App

### 🛠 Requirements
- Python 3.x  
- No external libraries needed — only the built-in `tkinter` module.

> On Linux, if `tkinter` is not available, you may need to install it:
```bash
sudo apt-get install python3-tk
````

### ▶️ Run the App

Clone this repository and run the script:
---
python notepad.py
---

The application window will open with a basic text editor.
